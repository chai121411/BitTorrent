BitTorrent Phase I

-- RUBTClient class

We take a torrent file and parse the data inside using the given TorrentInfo class. \\
Then, we connect to the tracker with a randomly generatedID and get the tracker info. \\
Bencoder2 was used to decode the tracker info. \\
From that we make a peer list, taking those that begin with the peerID `-RU'. For phase I, we are only downloading from one peer. \\
After building the peer list, we perform a handshake to the remote peer to try to download the file. \\
Upon successful communication with the peer, the file will be wrote into a path specified by argsv[1]. \\

-- Peer class

The Peer class represents a peer retrieved from peers inside tracker info. \\
Each peer is constructed by its peerID, IP, and port number. \\
The Peer class is also used to perform handshaking. \\
Necessary fields likes output streams and input streams are stored inside this class. \\

-- PeerMessage class
